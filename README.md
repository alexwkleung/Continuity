# Installation 

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2. Clone the repository or download the [latest release]().

```bash
git clone <SSH/HTTPS URL>
```

3. Change directory

```bash
cd <...>/Continuity
```

4. Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

# Usage 

1. Edit `resume.md` located in the `src/client` directory. A template skeleton is already created, so you just need to fill it in.

2. If you do not like the current style/theme of the resume, you can modify `style.css` located in the `src/client/styles` directory.

3. Once you're ready to generate the PDF file, run the script below:

```bash
# generate PDF file from markdown skeleton
npm run resume
# or
make resume
```

4. The generated resume PDF (`resume.pdf`) will be located in the `src/client/output-pdf` directory.

5. If you want to preview the HTML version of the resume, you can run the following scripts to open the server. Alternatively, you can just open `resume.html` located in the `src/client/output-html` directory if you don't want to use the server. 

**Note:** The HTML version may not be visually identical to the generated PDF due to formatting differences caused by the conversion.

```bash
# compile
npm run resume
# or 
npm run build
# or 
make build
# or
make resume

# run server
npm run server
# or
make server
```
